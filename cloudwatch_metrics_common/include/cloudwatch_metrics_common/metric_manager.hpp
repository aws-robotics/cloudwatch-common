 * will periodically pass these buffers to a MetricsPublisher in order to send them out to
 * CloudWatch. In order for periodic tasks to be executed the user should call the Service()
 * function.
 *
 *  This class is not thread safe. Metrics should only be enqueued from a single thread at a time.
 *
 *  The class will only flush a single set of buffers at a time. So while you can still enqueue new
 * metrics while the previously buffered metrics are being published in the background, the
 * MetricManage will not attempt to publish again until after the ongoing publish finishes.
