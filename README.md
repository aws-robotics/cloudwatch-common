## Installation

### Binaries
On Ubuntu you can install the latest version of the packages in this repository using the following command

        sudo apt-get update

### Building from Source

To build from source you'll need to create a new workspace, clone and checkout the latest release branch of this repository, install all the dependencies, and compile. If you need the latest development features you can clone from the `master` branch instead of the latest release branch. While we guarantee the release branches are stable, __the `master` should be considered to have an unstable build__ due to ongoing development. 

- Create a ROS workspace and a source directory

        mkdir -p ~/ros-workspace/src

- Clone the package into the source directory . 

        cd ~/ros-workspace/src
        git clone https://github.com/aws-robotics/cloudwatch-common.git -b release-latest

- Install dependencies

        cd ~/ros-workspace 
        sudo apt-get update && rosdep update
        rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
        
_Note: If building the master branch instead of a release branch you may need to also checkout and build the master branches of the packages this package depends on._

- Build the packages

        cd ~/ros-workspace && colcon build

- Configure ROS library path

        source ~/ros-workspace/install/local_setup.bash
